    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our goal is to analyze and identify the salient eating habits, lifestyle choices, and any genetic predispositions of individuals that generally lead to obesity. We are using tabular data from the UCI Machine Learning Data Repository with data about individuals and obesity from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. Some of the metrics in the dataset include family history of overweight, daily meal count, and time spent physically active. We plan to use an unsupervised machine learning model to identify any trends or clustering of data, specifically k-means clustering if the data have similar variance. We plan to evaluate the performance of the model using silhouette scores to see the frequency of data within and cluster and the distance of clusters from each other. If we see that there are certain factors that correlate amongst points in clusters, we may be able to conclude stronger associations between those points and certain types of obesity.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Obesity is a widespread global health crisis that causes severe health complications and costs billions of dollars annually in treatments. As of 2016, about 340 million people were classified as obese and 1.9 billion were classified as overweight<a name=\"who\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#who). In the United States, obesity disproportionately affects certain racial groups at higher rates; non-Hispanic Black adults showed an obesity prevalence of roughly 49% and Hispanic adults showed an obesity prevalence of roughly 45%<a name=\"cdc\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#cdc). Obesity also demonstrates higher rates of prevalence based on socioeconomic status, with college graduates showing lower rates of obesity when compared to adults with less education─this further breaks down when taking into account sex and race. This epidemic does not solely apply to adults as roughly 340 million children were diagnosed as either obese or overweight in 2016<a name=\"who\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#who).\n",
    "\n",
    "These staggering proportions are extremely alarming as obesity increases the risk of other severe health conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, type II diabetes, and some types of cancer (colon, prostate, and rectum cancer in men and breast, uterine, and gallbladder cancer in women)<a name=\"niddk\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#niddk). Not only are these conditions harmful, they also increase financial burden. In the United States, those who are overweight or obese pay on average $2000 more annually in healthcare costs than those at healthy weights<a name=\"cdc\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#cdc). \n",
    "\n",
    "Even with these sobering statistics, obesity trends have continued to increase amongst all age groups, sexes, and racial groups, with global obesity nearly tripling since 1975<a name=\"who\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#who). The causes of obesity are a mix of both genetic and environmental factors, such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior.  This is an extremely prevalent issue and one of the most pressing healthcare crises facing Americans, so in this project we hope to see which factors may be contributing more to obesity prevalence.\n"
